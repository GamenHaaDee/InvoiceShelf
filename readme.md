## Introduction

InvoiceShelf is an open-source web & mobile app that helps you track expenses, payments & create professional invoices & estimates.

The Web Application is made using Laravel & VueJS while the Mobile Apps are built using React Native.

To get started with InvoiceShelf using Docker Compose, check out the [Installation docs](https://docs.invoiceshelf.com/installation.html).

# Docker quick start

The repository now includes ready-to-use Docker Compose definitions so you can run InvoiceShelf with a single command.

1. Install the latest versions of [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/) and [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/).
2. From the project root, build and start the containers:

   ```bash
   docker compose up --build -d
   ```

   The default stack uses SQLite for storage and exposes the app at [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080).
3. Run database migrations (only needed on the first boot or after pulling new migrations):

   ```bash
   docker compose exec app php artisan migrate --force
   ```

4. Tail the application logs if you need to debug anything:

   ```bash
   docker compose logs -f app
   ```

Configuration is driven by environment variables in [`docker-compose.yml`](docker-compose.yml). You can override any value by creating a `.env` file next to the compose file (for example to change the exposed port you can add `INVOICESHELF_HTTP_PORT=9090` and update `APP_URL=http://localhost:9090`). Persisted application files live in the `invoiceshelf_storage` volume and can be inspected with `docker volume inspect invoiceshelf_storage`.

### Using MariaDB instead of SQLite

If you would prefer MariaDB, include the override file while starting the stack:

```bash
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.mysql.yml up --build -d
```

This spins up an additional `mysql` service defined in [`docker-compose.mysql.yml`](docker-compose.mysql.yml) and automatically points the Laravel container at it. Credentials can be customised through `.env` variables such as `MYSQL_DATABASE`, `MYSQL_USER`, and `MYSQL_PASSWORD`. The database files are persisted in the `invoiceshelf_mysql` volume.
